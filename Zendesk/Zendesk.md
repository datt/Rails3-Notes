# Support and Ticketing - Zendesk

* A ticket system is software that manages and maintains lists of support issues. A ticketing system creates a ticket based on a customer interaction: a phone call, an email, chat, or more recently even a tweet or other action shared through social media channels.

* Here’s a live scenario to demonstrate how a common support ticketing system, like Zendesk, works:
     * A customer advocate (agent, technician, representative) receives a telephone call, email, chat or other communication like a tweet from social media channels, from a customer about a problem.
     * The customer advocate verifies that the problem is real, and not just perceived, opens a ticket in the support ticket system, and obtains more information from the customer about the problem on the ticket. This information generally includes the environment of the customer, when and how the issue occurs, and all other relevant circumstances.
     * As corrective action is taken on the issue, the related support ticket is routed through the support ticketing system in a streamlined workflow, updated with new data by the customer advocate.
     * After the issue has been fully addressed, it is marked as resolved in the support ticket system.
